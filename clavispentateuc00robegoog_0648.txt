(a) Dodor Mead acknowledgeth, that it is much more difficult to
account for the infeclion of the houses: For it seems hardly poffibte
in nature that the le rous spots shoutd grow and spread on walls made
qs solid materials. Eut, upon a serious confideration ot the different
iubstances employed in building the walls of houses, such as stones,
lime, bituininous earth, hair of anmals, and other such things mixed
, together, 1 thought it probable that they may, by a kind of fermen-

measure resembled the leprous scabs ou the human body, were named
the leprosy of an hbuse. Where we may reasonably suppose, that
this moisture or meuldiness, gradutlly coming forth, and spreading
’ on the walls, might prove very prejudicial to the inhabitants, by its
stinking and uuwholesorne smell, without having recourse to any
¹ contagious quality 'tn it. And, somewhat analogous to this, is pretty
frequently observable in out· own houses, where, when the watls ate
plaisteted with bad mortar. the calcarious and nitrous salts sweat out
upon their surface, of a colour almost as white as sumt. See Mead,

as above, p. 166·
